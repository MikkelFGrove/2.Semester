**Exercise 1**
In this exercise, you are supposed to print even numbers from 1 to 10 using recursive approach. To do this, we have provided a class called “Main.java” in the package Exercise1.
Main.java is partially implemented and responsible for printing the even numbers from 1 to 10, using both iterative and recursive approach.
- A iterativeEven() method is already implemented to print even numbers using iterative approach.
- A main() method is already implemented.
  Complete the implementation of the class.
- Implement recursiveEven()method to print even numbers from 1 to 10 using recursive approach.
- Run “Main.java” to test your implementation. <br>
**The output should look like the following:**


    Even numbers from 1 to 10 (iterative):
    2 4 6 8 10
    Even numbers from 1 to 10 (recursive):
    2 4 6 8 10

**Exercise 2**
In this exercise, you are supposed to print table of 3 using recursive approach. To do this, we have provided a class called “Main.java” in the package Exercise2.
Main.java is partially implemented and responsible for printing the Table of 2, using both iterative and recursive approach.
- A iterativeTable() method is already implemented to print table of 3 using iterative approach.
- A main() method is already implemented.
  Complete the implementation of the class.
- Implement recursiveTable()method to print table of 3 using recursive approach.
- Run “Main.java” to test your implementation. <br>
  **The output should look like the following:**


    Table of 3 (iterative):
    3 x 1 = 3
    3 x 2 = 6
    3 x 3 = 9
    3 x 4 = 12
    3 x 5 = 15
    3 x 6 = 18
    3 x 7 = 21
    3 x 8 = 24
    3 x 9 = 27
    3 x 10 = 30
    
    Table of 3 (recursive):
    3 x 1 = 3
    3 x 2 = 6
    3 x 3 = 9
    3 x 4 = 12
    3 x 5 = 15
    3 x 6 = 18
    3 x 7 = 21
    3 x 8 = 24
    3 x 9 = 27
    3 x 10 = 30

**Exercise 3**
In this exercise, you are supposed to compute sum of natural numbers using recursive approach. To do this, we have provided a class called “Main.java” in the package Exercise3.
Main.java is partially implemented and responsible for computing sum of natural numbers from 1 to 50, using both iterative and recursive approach.
- A iterativeSum() method is already implemented to compute sum of natural numbers using iterative approach.
- A main() method is already implemented.
  Complete the implementation of the class.
- Implement recursiveSum()method to compute sum of natural numbers from 1 to 50 using recursive approach.
- Run “Main.java” to test your implementation. <br>
  **The output should look like the following:**


    Sum (iterative): 1257
    Sum (recursive): 1257
