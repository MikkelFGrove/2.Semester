“That’s because I don’t make pretenses. People think that anyone who is
still frank and simple must be very young--and very foolish.... I’ve
been out four years. Do I seem ignorant and uninteresting to you?”

“No--very frank--naïve.”

She smiled, flushed, glanced shyly at him. “Do you know, I feel I know
you better than I ever knew any man in my life--even my brothers!”

“Everyone says I’m easy to get acquainted with,” said he, practical and
unappreciative.

She looked disappointed, but persisted. “I feel freer to talk with
you. I’d tell you--anything--the things I think, but never dare say.”

“There aren’t any such things,” said he, hastening away from the
personal. “Anything one really thinks one can’t help saying.”

“Oh, that isn’t a bit true,” cried she. “I think lots of things I don’t
dare say, just as I want to do lots of things I don’t dare do.”

“You _imagine_ you think them, you _imagine_ you want to do them,” he
assured her. “But really, what you say and do--that is your real self.”

She sighed. “I hate to believe so.”

“Yes. It is unpleasant to give up the flattering notion that our grand
dreams are our real selves, and that our mean little schemes and
actions are just accidental--or devil--or somebody else besides self.”

She looked at him and he was astonished to see that there were tears in
her eyes. “Don’t--please!” she pleaded. “Don’t make it harder for me to
do what I’ve got to do.”

“Got to do? Nonsense.”

“No, indeed,” said she, intensely in earnest. “Remember, I’m a woman.
And a woman has got to do--what’s expected of her.”

“So has a man if he’s the weak sort.”
