Task 2 - Subtask 1.
Horse transportation is booming across the world and the company ‘HorseShoes’ sells a lot of premium horseshoes for both customers in Denmark and customers in USA. For that reason, they want a database which satisfies the following constraints: 
• Fault tolerance 
	o In case of natural disasters, data should not be lost.
• Fast database speeds for both customers in USA and Denmark 
	o They want to increase performance by gradually adding more servers. 
• Because of GDPR the data from Denmark cannot be replicated in USA

1. How would you split the data? 
	a. What is the method of splitting data called?
2. Where would this database place in the CAP theorem? 
	a. Explain your answer.
3. Is the database horizontally or vertically scaled?
-------------------------------------------------
1. I would split it vertically, so that the possibility to not store GDPR sensitive information in the US servers is possible.

2. It would only be able to satisfy partition tolerance and availability, because of natural disasters it should satisfy partition tolerance. Availability because of fast speeds and low downtime.

3. The database would be scaled horizontally, so it is easier to increase performance by adding more servers
