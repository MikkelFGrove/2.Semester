3. What is the CAP theorem, and how would you explain it?
In simpler terms, the CAP theorem implies that a distributed system can only guarantee two of the three properties at the same time:

	•	If you prioritize Consistency and Availability (CA), you must sacrifice Partition Tolerance. This means the system cannot handle network failures.
	•	If you prioritize Consistency and Partition Tolerance (CP), you must sacrifice Availability. This means some requests might fail or take a long time during network issues.
	•	If you prioritize Availability and Partition Tolerance (AP), you must sacrifice Consistency. This means the system may return outdated or inconsistent data during network issues.
