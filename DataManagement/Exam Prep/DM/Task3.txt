Relational database use sql, where the two others are no-sql meaning they also use different languages to script in. Relational store data in tables(rows and columns), while the key-value, as the name suggests, has 1 key for each value. Time series, which is a part of the Coloumn-Family databases, store data inside columns, instead of rows this is ideal for quick fast read and write performance. It it is closer to relational databases, than key-value in that regard, but is still a no-sql type, and do not emphasise the relations or constraints in a schema.
